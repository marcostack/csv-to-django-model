# django-model-to-csv
Script created to automate the development of Django model schemas based on CSV file


I created this script because I needed to create a schema model for Django that had more than 100 columns based on a CSV file.

The first time I created the template schematic, I did it completely manual. In this period were two schemes. Later on the provider of the csv files gathered everything into one and changed the name of some columns.

As the manual work was very hard, I started looking for some python library to help me, but I did not get much success, so I decided to create my own script.

And there it is, for anyone who wants to use it!
